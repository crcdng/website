## About Me

**Berlin-based systems theorist, artist and play designer.**

My interests include systems theory, play, games, art and cybernetics. I create Playful AI and Imperfect VR. I received a Master-level degree at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (Diplom-Informatiker) and a practice-based PhD from the School of Art, Design and Architecture at the University of Plymouth as a Marie Curie Fellow.

I have been teaching at Leuphana University Lüneburg, been a lecturer and Award Leader in Game Arts and Design at the University of Plymouth and Nanjing University of the Arts. I hold a Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA).

Besides that, I have a couple of years digital agency experience and have worked and played in a wide range of environments, from large corporate clients to fringe theatre ensembles. I catsit occasionally 😻.

## Topics

Areas of interest I am currently engaged with:

### 🔄 Systems Theory
I am actively engaged in artistic research into cybernetics, radical constructivism and systems theory.

### 🤖 AI / Robots
My work with AI focuses on communication between humans and machines, a fascinating and important topic.

### 💻 Creative Coding
Creative Coding is an exciting mix of technology and art. I believe that everyone can (not: should) learn to code.

### 🖼 Digital Art
I like to play with the paradoxes, contradictions, and strange loops inherent in the art system.

### 🕹 Playful Interactions
My game / play projects start from the premise that games, theatre and events are media and environments for play.

### 💜 Communication
Communication is at the heart of what I do: writing, teaching, talking, organizing, discussing.

## Essays

I occasionally write about topics at the intersection of art and technology. Some of the material is brandnew, other drafts have been sitting on my desk for a while, and some essays have been published before, to be re-edited. Essays feature topics such as AI, VR, art, play, systems or communication, often discussed from a personal experience perspective.
